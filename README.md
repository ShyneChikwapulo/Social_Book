## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

note: to use the News-API you need to create an account "https://newsapi.org", then get your free api key. Create a config.py file in the main directory and write this line of code in the file and save the file:
```bash
NEWS_API_KEY="paste your api key in here"
```

Step 1: Navigate to the Project Folder
Open your terminal and change the directory to the project folder:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment named myenv. This isolates your project's dependencies from the system-wide Python installation:
```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```

Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment to start using it:
```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

Step 4: Install Requirements
Install the project dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 5: Run the Server
